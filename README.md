# SQLite Database Management

## Description

A simple Python project for managing an SQLite database, including database creation, table definition, and data insertion.


### Requirements
- Python
- SQLite3

### Usage

1. Edit the main.py file to customize the data you want to insert into the database.

2. Run the program:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Usage
You can customize the data and the database settings in the main.py file. The program is designed to read data from various file formats (e.g., JSON, CSV, XML) and insert it into an SQLite database. Make sure to adjust the file paths, database names, and data sources as needed for your specific use case.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to suit your database management needs.
